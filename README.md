## A MUCH better solution: [Precognitive](https://precognitive.com/account-takeover/)

You can use a version of the naive demo but if you want to do more than just stop the simplest
of attacks you should take a look at Precognitive. We've spent the last 4 years building a platform
that not only stops Credential stuffing using (much more sophisticated) similar tools as the demo
but also using Behavioral analytics and modeling to make sure not matter the use case we can tell 
the bad guys from the good guys.
